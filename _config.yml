  Hi, my name's Daan and I'm a <mark>C#</mark> and <mark>PLC</mark> (Siemens, Beckhoff and Sigmatek) software developer. I code industrial software applications for the warehousing and distribution sector. If you have received a parcel from companies like DHL, GLS, Budbee, Zalando, DPD and Fedex your parcel is possibly sorted by the software I made.
